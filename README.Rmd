title: "OneSDM: Automated Workflows for Invasive Alien Species Distribution Modelling"
output: github_document
---

## Overview

As part of the One Biosecurity approach for terrestrial invasive alien species implemented in the OneSTOP project, OneSDM provides functionality for automated species distribution modelling. The entire SDM workflow can be run with minimal input from the user using default settings, while also offering full flexibility for more experienced users. The package includes fine-grained functions to download and prepare input data, model species distributions, and post-process model predictions, as well as wrapper functions that allow an entire workflow to be executed with just a few lines of code.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `OneSDM` from GitHub using the `remotes` package:

``` r
# Install remotes if not already installed
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")

# Install OneSDM from GitHub
remotes::install_github("MarinaGolivets/OneSDM", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Dependencies

The `OneSDM` package depends on several R packages for its functionality. Check the [`DESCRIPTION`](DESCRIPTION) file for a complete list of dependencies.

The <a href="https://github.com/elgabbas/ecokit" target="_blank">`ecokit`</a> package is one of the key dependencies used for ecological data handling and analysis. Make sure to install/update it before using `OneSDM`:

``` r
if (!require("ecokit")) remotes::install_github("elgabbas/ecokit", dependencies = TRUE)
# or update if already installed
remotes::update_packages("ecokit")
```
