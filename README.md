# OneSTOP-Task-5.2 Automated workflows for species distribution modelling under environmental change scenarios

To identify species likely to establish, spread and impose threats on native ecosystems in Europe, we will
develop workflows to dynamically model potential current and future species distributions of a range of
terrestrial IAS of Union and regional concern. The workflows will enable regular automatic updates of the
models and their respective predictions to make use of newly available data, including those generated in
T2.1–T2.4, and will build on the work currently performed in the projects BioDT and B3 (see Table 1.2.2.1).
We will review cutting-edge advances in modelling (such as Bayesian joint SDMs and integrated SDMs) and
will develop these within our workflows where they are practicable and likely to support effective data
integration and better model outputs (e.g. better propagation of model uncertainty for prioritisation and
impact assessments). We will project the potential future distributions and impacts of IAS to 2050 under four
recently developed scenarios of socio-economic development (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) and climate
change (Representative Concentration Pathways)
