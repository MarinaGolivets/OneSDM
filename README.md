OneSDM: Automated Workflows for Species Distribution Modelling
================

# OneSTOP-Task-5.2 Automated workflows for species distribution modelling under environmental change scenarios

## Overview

To identify species likely to establish, spread and impose threats on
native ecosystems in Europe, we will develop workflows to dynamically
model potential current and future species distributions of a range of
terrestrial IAS of Union and regional concern. The workflows will enable
regular automatic updates of the models and their respective predictions
to make use of newly available data, including those generated in
T2.1–T2.4, and will build on the work currently performed in the
projects BioDT and B3 (see Table 1.2.2.1). We will review cutting-edge
advances in modelling (such as Bayesian joint SDMs and integrated SDMs)
and will develop these within our workflows where they are practicable
and likely to support effective data integration and better model
outputs (e.g. better propagation of model uncertainty for prioritisation
and impact assessments). We will project the potential future
distributions and impacts of IAS to 2050 under four recently developed
scenarios of socio-economic development (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways)
and climate change (Representative Concentration Pathways)
