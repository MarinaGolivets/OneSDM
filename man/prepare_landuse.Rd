\title{Process Land-Use Data for Multiple Climate Scenarios and Years}
\usage{
prepare_landuse(
  agg_factors = c(5L, 10L, 20L),
  n_cores = 20L,
  climate_scenarios = c("SSP1_RCP26", "SSP3_RCP70", "SSP5_RCP85"),
  climate_years = c(2025L, 2055L, 2085L),
  temp_dir = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{agg_factors}{Integer vector. Aggregation factors (resolutions) to
process land-use data at. Must be positive integers. Defaults to \code{c(5L, 10L, 20L)} for 5, 10, and 20 arc-minutes resolutions.}

\item{n_cores}{Integer. Number of CPU cores to use for parallel processing.
Default: 20L.}

\item{climate_scenarios}{Character vector. Climate scenarios to process. Must
be a subset of: \code{c("SSP1_RCP19", "SSP1_RCP26", "SSP2_RCP45", "SSP3_RCP70", "SSP4_RCP34", "SSP4_RCP60", "SSP5_RCP34", "SSP5_RCP85")}. Defaults to
climate scenarios overlapping with CHELSA climate data: \code{c("SSP1_RCP26", "SSP3_RCP70", "SSP5_RCP85")}.}

\item{climate_years}{Integer vector. Years to process. Must be in 5-year
steps between 2020 and 2100. Defaults to years overlapping with CHELSA
climate data: \code{c(2025L, 2055L, 2085L)}.}

\item{temp_dir}{Character or \code{NULL}. Path to temporary directory for
intermediate files. If \code{NULL}, a new temporary directory is created. The
directory and its contents are deleted after processing.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. Side effects include saving processed
raster files and a summary RData file (\code{landuse/landuse_results.RData})
containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{majority}: Tibble with file paths to majority class rasters.
\item \code{percent_pft}: Tibble with file paths to percentage coverage rasters for
each PFT.
\item \code{percent_pft_cw}: Tibble with file paths to percentage coverage rasters
for each PFT cross-walk group.
}

\description{
Downloads, extracts, and processes global land-use data under
various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative
Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios. Data is sourced from a
\href{https://10.5281/zenodo.4584775}{Zenodo} repository and processed at
multiple spatial resolutions using specified land masks. See Chen et al.
(\href{https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01208-6}{2022}) for details on the
land-use dataset. The function aggregates land-use rasters to specified
resolutions, computes majority and percentage coverage maps for plant
functional types (PFTs) and their cross-walked groups, and saves the
results for future use.
}
\details{
This function is not intended to be called by the end user if the
\code{OneSDM} package, but to prepare climate data for use in species
distribution modelling workflows.

The function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
\item Checks validity of input arguments.
\item Downloads land-use data from \code{Zenodo} if not already processed.
\item Extracts relevant files for the specified scenarios and years.
\item Aggregates rasters to the specified resolutions using provided land masks.
\item Computes:
\itemize{
\item Majority class maps (mode) for each scenario/year/resolution.
\item Percentage coverage maps for each original PFT class.
\item Percentage coverage maps for cross-walked PFT groups.
}
\item Saves results as TIFF files and a summary RData file.
