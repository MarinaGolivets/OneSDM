\arguments{
\item{model_dir, models_prefix}{Character.
\itemize{
\item \code{model_dir} (required) represents the path to the root modelling
directory where data and fitted models will be saved. This should be a
single directory for all models of a given species (a separate directory is
expected in case of modelling multiple species, otherwise data files may be
overwritten or mixed up). It can also be set via the "\code{onesdm_model_dir}"
option.
\item \code{models_prefix} (defaults to "\code{models}") is the character prefix for
model subdirectory under \code{model_dir}. This is helpful when fitting multiple
sets of models for the same species (e.g., using different SDM methods or
settings) to avoid overwriting files.
\item The function creates two subdirectories: "\code{data}" to store processed
species data, and "\verb{<models_prefix>_res_<resolution>}" to store model data
and outputs for the specified resolution.
}}

\item{climate_dir}{Character (required). Directory path for climate data
files. This directory is used to load/download mask layers matching the
specified resolution and current/future climate and land use data (see
below). The same directory should be used across \code{OneSDM} workflows for
different models (including different species, predictors, resolutions,
etc.) to ensure consistency and redundant re-download of large geospatial
data. This can be set via the "\code{onesdm_climate_dir}" option.}

\item{resolution}{Integer. Spatial resolution used to prepare data for
analysis and model fitting. Valid values are 5, 10 (default), or 20,
corresponding to approximate spatial resolutions of 5, 10, and 20 km (2.5,
5, and 10 arc-minutes) respectively. This value can also be set via the
"\code{onesdm_resolution}" option.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), prints progress and information
messages. Can be set via the "\code{onesdm_verbose}" option.}

\item{easin_ids}{Character vector (Optional). One or more EASIN species IDs,
each starting with "R" followed by five digits (e.g., "R00544"). Species
IDs can be obtained from the \href{https://easin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/spexplorer/search/}{EASIN website} by searching
for a species and checking its "EASIN ID" in the species details section.
When multiple IDs are provided, data are collated across all IDs. If \code{NULL}
(default), the function attempts to retrieve IDs from the
"\code{onesdm_easin_ids}" option and skips the EASIN download if no IDs are set.
For more details, see \link{prepare_easin_data}.}

\item{gbif_ids}{Character or numeric (optional). A vector of one or more GBIF
taxon keys. When multiple IDs are supplied, data are combined across all
keys. If \code{NULL} (default), the function attempts to retrieve IDs from the
"\code{onesdm_gbif_ids}" option. If no IDs are set, the GBIF download step is
skipped. To request data from GBIF, GBIF credentials must be set for the
current session, otherwise an error will be raised. For more, see
\link{prepare_gbif_data}, and this
\href{https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/articles/gbif_credentials.html}{article}
from \code{rgbif} R package documentation on how to set the GBIF credentials.}

\item{coordinates}{A data frame or matrix (optional). A user-supplied object
containing longitude and latitude values in two columns (in that order).
Must have exactly two columns. If \code{NULL} (default), the function attempts
to retrieve coordinates from the "\code{onesdm_coordinates}" option. See
\code{\link[=prepare_user_data]{prepare_user_data()}} for details.}

\item{climate_scenario, climate_model, climate_year}{Character vectors. Future
climate scenario(s), model(s), and year(s). These three parameters control
which future climate data will be prepared for future predictions (data for
selected variables at current climate conditions will be always prepared):
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{climate_scenario}}: Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Valid
values are: \code{"ssp126"}, \code{"ssp370"}, \code{"ssp585"}, \code{"all"} (default), or
\code{"none"}. This can also be set via the "\code{onesdm_climate_scenario}" option.
\item \strong{\code{climate_model}}: abbreviation for future climate model(s). Valid
values are: \code{"gfdl"}, \code{"ipsl"}, \code{"mpi"}, \code{"mri"}, \code{"ukesm1"}, \code{"all"}
(default), or \code{"none"}. This can also be set via the
"\code{onesdm_climate_model}" option.
\item \strong{\code{climate_year}}: future year range(s). Valid values are:
\code{"2011_2040"}, \code{"2041_2070"}, \code{"2071_2100"}, \code{"all"} (default), \code{"none"}.
This can also be set via the "\code{onesdm_climate_year}" option.
}

Multiple values are possible for each of the three parameters, each
provided as a character vector. Combinations of scenario × model × year
will be prepared. This is unless any of the three parameters is set to
\code{"none"} or \code{NULL}, in which case no future climate data will be prepared.
For more details, see \link{climate_data} and
\link{get_climate_data}.}

\item{var_names}{Character vector of climate variable codes to download. See
\link{climate_data} for the list of valid climate variable names. Can be
set via the "\code{onesdm_var_names}" option. This parameter is \emph{required} and
cannot be \code{NULL}.}

\item{pft_type, pft_id}{Information on the plant functional type (PFT)
parameters for land-use predictors (optional). See \link{landuse_data}
and \link{get_landuse_data} for details.
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{pft_type}}: PFT to download land-use predictors for. Must be one of
"\code{cross-walk}" (default) or "\code{original}". This can be set via the
"\code{onesdm_pft_type}" option.
\item \strong{\code{pft_id}}: Numeric vector. One or more PFT identifiers to download.
Must be valid for the specified \code{pft_type}: 1-20 for \code{"original"}, and 1-12
for \code{"cross-walk"}. If \code{NULL} (default), no land-use predictors are used.
This can be set via the "\code{onesdm_pft_id}" option.
}}

\item{bias_group}{Character scalar. Taxonomic group used to compute sampling
effort surface. Valid options are \code{"amphibians"}, \code{"birds"}, \code{"mammals"},
\code{"molluscs"}, \code{"plants"}, \code{"reptiles"}, or \code{"none"}; all in small case.
Default is \code{"none"}; i.e., no sampling-effort predictor is used. If not
"none", the function downloads sampling-effort raster of the specified
group from \href{https://zenodo.org/records/7556851}{Zenodo}. See
\link{get_sampling_efforts} for details. This can also be set via the
"\code{onesdm_bias_group}" option.
\itemize{
\item When not "none", the sampling-effort raster
(log\if{html}{\out{<sub>}}10\if{html}{\out{</sub>}} scale) is used as a predictor in the models. The
90\if{html}{\out{<sup>}}th\if{html}{\out{</sup>}}-percentile value of the  sampling-effort raster in the
modelling study area (after filtering; i.e., presence grid cells +
candidate grid cells for pseudo-absence sampling, see blow) is used across
the whole study area to correct for sampling bias in projections (but not
during models evaluation). For more details on model-based sampling bias
correction, see Warton et al.
(\href{https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0079168}{2013}).
\item The \code{bias} predictor, if used, is enforced to be kept during VIF
screening (see below).
}}

\item{vif_th}{Numeric. Variance inflation factor (VIF) threshold for
multicollinearity screening. Predictors with VIF larger than this value are
excluded. Default is \code{10}.
\itemize{
\item This argument refers to the \code{th} parameter of the \link[usdm:vif]{usdm::vifstep}
function. This can also be set via the "\code{onesdm_vif_th}" option.
\item The function checks if the option "\code{onesdm_vif_sample}" is set in the
current R session; if so, its value (numeric integer) is used as the
\code{sample} argument of \link[usdm:vif]{usdm::vifstep}. This option controls the number of
random sample points drawn from the study area raster stack. If not set,
the default value is used (5000).
\item Similarly, if the option "\code{onesdm_vif_keep}" is set in the current R
session, its value (a character vector of predictor names) is used as the
\code{exclude} argument of \link[usdm:vif]{usdm::vifstep}. This option allows specifying
predictors that should always be retained regardless of their VIF values.
If not set, no predictors are forced to be kept. If a valid \code{bias_group} is
provided, the corresponding \code{bias} predictor is always included in this
list to ensure it is retained during VIF screening.
}}

\item{pres_buffer}{Numeric or \code{NULL}. Distance in kilometres. Non-presence
grid cells beyond this distance from any presence grid cells are masked out
of the modelling area (i.e., no pseudo-absences will be sampled there).
This helps to exclude areas that are unlikely to be accessible to the
species or are too environmentally distant from the known species
presences. Larger values lead to more inclusive modelling areas. If \code{NULL}
or \eqn{\leq 0}, no presences-based masking is applied (i.e.,
pseudo-absences can be sampled anywhere in the study area). Default is
\code{1000} km. This can be set via the "\code{onesdm_pres_buffer}" option.}

\item{abs_buffer}{Numeric or \code{NULL}. Minimum distance in kilometres from
presence points inside which pseudo-absences will not be sampled. This
helps avoid sampling pseudo-absences in nearby areas of presences that are
likely to be suitable (e.g., due to spatial autocorrelation) or are already
occupied by the species. Larger values lead to more conservative
pseudo-absence sampling. If \code{NULL} or \eqn{\leq 0}, no presence-based
pseudo-absence exclusion buffer is applied (i.e., pseudo-absences can be
sampled anywhere in the study area except at presence grid cells). Default
is \code{10} km. This can be set via the "\code{onesdm_abs_buffer}" option.}

\item{abs_exclude_ext}{List (Optional). A list of terra \code{SpatExtent} objects,
typically generated using \link[terra:ext]{terra::ext}. Each extent defines a geographic
area (rectangles) where pseudo-absences will not be sampled. This is useful
for excluding regions such as areas outside the species' native range or
regions with specific environmental conditions that preclude the species'
presence. If an empty list (default), no additional exclusion extents are
applied. This can also be set via the "\code{onesdm_abs_exclude_ext}" option.}

\item{min_pres_grids}{Integer. Minimum number of presence grid cells required
to proceed with modelling. If the number of presence grid cells after
filtering is less than this value, the function will stop with an error.
Default is \strong{\code{50}} grids. This can also be set via
"\code{onesdm_min_pres_grids}" option.}

\item{cv_folds, cv_block_size, cv_random}{Parameters controlling spatial-block
cross-validation.
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{cv_folds}}: Integer. Number of cross-validation folds. Default is
\code{5}. This can also be set via the "\code{onesdm_cv_folds}" option.
\item \strong{\code{cv_block_size}}: Numeric. Approximate cross-validation block
size in kilometres. Larger block sizes lead to fewer, more spatially
distinct blocks. The function checks if the provided value is feasible
given the study area extent and number of CV folds; if not, it adjusts the
block size to ensure at least \code{cv_folds} blocks can fit within the study
area. This helps to avoid situations where the block size is too large
relative to the study area, leading to insufficient blocks for
cross-validation. Default is \code{500} km. This can also be set via the
"\code{onesdm_cv_block_size}" option.
\item \strong{\code{cv_random}}: Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), create random spatial
blocks by aggregating and randomly assigning blocks into \code{cv_folds} groups.
Although this is done randomly, the function tries to ensure that each fold
has a balanced number of presence grid cells. If \code{FALSE},
\link[blockCV:cv_spatial]{blockCV::cv_spatial} is used for block determination. Note that
\link[blockCV:cv_spatial]{blockCV::cv_spatial} can be computationally intensive for large study
areas and small block sizes. This can also be set via the
"\code{onesdm_cv_random}" option.
}}

\item{abs_ratio, model_n_reps}{Parameters for sampling pseudo-absences.
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{abs_ratio}}: Integer determining the ratio of sampled pseudo-absences
to training presences for each cross-validation fold. Default is \code{20},
which means that for each training presence grid cell, 20 pseudo-absence
grid cells will be sampled. This can also be set via the
"\code{onesdm_abs_ratio}" option.
\item \strong{\code{model_n_reps}}: Integer representing the number of repetition
datasets (different sets of pseudo-absences) to generate for each
cross-validation fold. Default is \code{5}, for five different pseudo-absence
sample datasets per CV fold (i.e., 5 fitted models per CV). If the
available non-presence grid cells become limiting (when the number of
requested pseudo-absences exceeds 80\% of available non-presence grid
cells), the function reduces the number of repetitions to \code{1} as further
repetitions would be redundant. This can also be set via the
"\code{onesdm_model_n_reps}" option.
\item Pseudo-absences are sampled using \link[sdm:background]{sdm::background} with method \code{"eDist"}
, which draws pseudo-absences weighted by environmental distance from
presence grid cells.
\item No pseudo-absences are sampled for maxent models; instead, all
available non-presence grid cells are used as background points (capped to
1,000,000 points for memory efficiency; can also be set using the
"\code{onesdm_max_n_bg_maxent}") option. Therefore, for maxent models,
\code{model_n_reps} is set to \code{1} regardless of the provided value.
}}

\item{n_cores}{Integer. Number of CPU cores to use for parallel processing of
data for cross-validation folds and for model fitting (capped to
\link[parallelly:availableCores]{parallelly::availableCores}). This can also be set via the
"\code{onesdm_model_n_cores}" option. Default is \code{4}.}

\item{sdm_methods}{Character vector. List of SDM methods to be used for model
fitting.
\itemize{
\item Default is c("glm", "glmnet", "gam", "maxent", "rf").
\item Valid methods are those supported by the \code{sdm} R package: \code{glm},
\code{glmpoly}, \code{gam}, \code{glmnet}, \code{mars}, \code{gbm}, \code{rf}, \code{ranger}, \code{cart}, \code{rpart},
\code{maxent}, \code{mlp}, \code{svm}, \code{mda}, and \code{fda}. See documentation of the \code{sdm} R
package for more details.
\item The \code{svm} method refers to the \link[kernlab:ksvm]{kernlab::ksvm} implementation of SVM.
However, the function also support the SVM implementation from the
\link[e1071:svm]{e1071::svm} R package, referred to as \code{svm2} here. This can be useful if
users prefer this implementation or have specific reasons to use it.
\item This can also be set via the "\code{onesdm_sdm_methods}" option.
}}

\item{sdm_settings}{List or \code{NULL}. A named list of lists, each containing
method-specific settings for SDM methods. Each list element should be named
after a valid SDM method (see "\code{sdm_methods}" above) and contain a list of
settings specific to that method.
\itemize{
\item For example: \code{list(glm = list(control = list(maxit = 200L)))}.
\item If \code{NULL} (default), pre-defined default settings are used; see
\link{sdm_model_settings}.
\item If an empty list, no additional method-specific settings are applied, and
default settings of the \code{sdm} R package are used.
\item This can also be set via the "\code{onesdm_sdm_settings}" option.
}}

\item{proj_extent}{Character scalar or list of \code{terra::SpatExtent} objects.
This parameter controls the geographic extent for saving model projections
under current and future climate scenarios.
\itemize{
\item Projections are made for all combinations of SDM model types, model
repetitions, cross-validation folds, and climate options.
\item Projections are run in parallel if \code{n_cores} is set to > 1.
\item Processing time and memory consumption during projections can be high
depending on the extent of the study area, modelling resolution, and
modelling options used.
\item Caution should be taken when projecting to areas very far from the model
fitting area due to high expected environmental extrapolation.
\item Valid options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"modelling_area"} (\emph{default}): predict only at grid cells within the
modelling study area (i.e., after filtering, where presence/non-presences
data are prepared).
\item \code{"europe"}: predict across Europe (using a predefined extent).
\item \code{"world"}: predict across the whole world land. This can highly slow
down the projection step (high memory consumption and processing time) and
should be chosen carefully only if needed.
\item A list of \code{terra::SpatExtent} objects, each defining a custom
geographic extent for projections. In this case, global land grid cells
overlap with these extents will be used for projections (irrespective of
the modelling area).
}
}}

\description{
Orchestrates the end-to-end species distribution modelling (SDM) workflow.
This includes preparing occurrence data, downloading and preparing predictors
(climate and land use), handling spatial sampling bias, variable selection
(collinearity filtering via VIF), building spatial-blocks for
cross-validation (CV), assembling modelling datasets, fitting multiple SDMs
using different methods with repetitions across CV folds, generating current and
future projections, and producing comprehensive summaries at repetition, CV-fold,
and overall levels. All intermediate artefacts and summaries are saved to a
structured output directory.
}
\details{
The function performs the following major steps:
\itemize{
\item Validates input arguments and resolves defaults from package options.
\item Calls \link{prepare_species_data} to check/prepare species
distribution data. This includes processing/loading occurrence data from
EASIN/GBIF or user-provided coordinates.
\item Masks and filters the study area using optional exclusion extents and
distances (\code{abs_exclude_ext}, \code{pres_buffer}, and \code{abs_buffer}).
\item Loads/download current climate (and optionally land-use) data for
selected predictors via \link{get_climate_data} and
\link{get_landuse_data}, combines them and masks them to the study area.
\item Loads/download future climate (and optionally land-use) predictors for
each requested scenario \eqn{\times} model \eqn{\times} year combination
(if any) via \link{get_climate_data} and \link{get_landuse_data}, and
masks them to the study area.
\item Optionally adds a sampling-effort (bias) predictor when \code{bias_group}
is valid.
\item Performs VIF-based predictor selection (using \link[usdm:vif]{usdm::vifstep}) and
excludes highly collinear variables. The \code{bias} predictor, if used, is
always retained.
\item Creates spatial cross-validation blocks either with a simple random-block
aggregation or via \link[blockCV:cv_spatial]{blockCV::cv_spatial} (controlled by \code{cv_random}).
\item Samples pseudo-absences per cross-validation fold/repetition.
\item Assembles modelling data (species, predictors, CV fold) and persists both
data.frame and wrapped \code{SpatRaster} for memory efficiency.
\item Determines feasible repetitions per CV fold based on available absences
and requested \code{abs_ratio}.
\item Enforces minimum presence count after filtering; otherwise, stops with
an error; controlled by \code{min_pres_count}.
\item Saves a tibble describing all model input data, including
cross-validation folds and model repetitions with file paths to persisted
datasets (training/testing rasters and pseudo-absence objects).
\item Fits models in parallel across tasks, capturing: fitted model path,
training and testing evaluation metrics, variable importance, response
curve data, and projection outputs for current and future scenarios.
\item Summarises results:
\itemize{
\item Per-CV-fold: aggregates repetitions (mean and sd where applicable) for
evaluations, variable importance, response curves; compiles projections.
\item Overall (per method): aggregates across folds for the same metrics and
summarizes projections.
}
\item Plots maps for species distribution data to be used in the models,
sampling efforts data used, and cross-validation spatial blocks used.
\item Saves all relevant intermediate files and final summaries to structured
directories: \code{modelling_data} (model inputs), \code{fitted_models} (fitted model
objects and results), "\code{projections_reps}" (raw projection maps per model
repetition), "\code{projections_cv}" (summary projection maps per CV fold), and
"\code{projections}" (overall summary maps), and metadata \code{RData} files.
